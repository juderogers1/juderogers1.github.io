Business VoIP solutions are inherently mobile and versatile, which provide themselves to the brand-new nature of constant on-the-go modern employees, who need to remain in touch no matter where they are.</p>
<p>However cloud phone systems do away with the PBX metaphor and rather go for a different idea: Unified Communications (UC). Some functions, such as voicemail to text, are unique to cloud-based phone systems. A micro-sized office could get by quickly with the bare-bones Office Pro setup, but the sophisticated functions of Office Pro Plus and Office Enterprise are tempting for a few dollars more: the Nextiva mobile voice and video app and the Group Existence status sign (both consisted of in Office Pro Plus) are useful upgrades, as are call recording and the number-meshing Nextiva Anyplace app (Office Enterprise).</p>
